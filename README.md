# ENV.conf
My ENV configuration files

### settings.json

A configuration file of vscode, disable the tabs or sth I dont care
Mostly for theme colors and the custom icons

### vagrant

My vagrantfiles, just record it

### vimrc

Not exist yet, I dont have much ask for vim
Maybe sometimes this file will appear

### gitconfig
